Just a few tools i made / gathered for houdini
theyre tested for houdini 21 but im going to try to get them working with older versions

to get stuff working please move the package json to your packages folder in you $HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR and the folder will probably be called ALTools-main or something like that jsut rename it to ALTools and it shoudl work

im also not a experieced dev so if something it stupid or werid thats why
